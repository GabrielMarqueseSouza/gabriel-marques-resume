## About this repo

💡This is a digital portfolio/resume, which I created as a way to utilize basic web development tools - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

It was my desire to build a website without using frameworks or complex tools, focusing on improving my basic knowledge of the fundamental building blocks of web development.

👍 Enjoy!
